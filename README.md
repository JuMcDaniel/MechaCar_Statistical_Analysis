## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg are the vehicle length and ground clearance.  This means that the longer or shorter the car is     the fuel efficiency is directly related.  Same with ground clearance.  The variable that is almsot statistically significant is vehicle weight; however with a p-vale     of 0.0776.
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  The slope of the linear model is NOT considered to be zero and we can regect the null hypothesis.  This because the the r-squared value is .71 which means that 71% of   the variability of the mpg is explained using this linear model.  In addition the p-value of the linear regression annalysis is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than our   assumed significance level of 0.05%.  
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  This linear model does predict mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively becasue of a statistically significant p-value and a rejection of the null hypothesis.
